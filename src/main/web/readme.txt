1.
Chrome won't allow http request to same domain                  
as both server and web app are running locally                  
you have to install allow-control-allow-origin chrome extension to chrome

2. 
I highly recommend using brackets (text editor) live preview to use the UI, opera and chrome have
problems with loading files from local domain ( same error as mentioned above )

While you have brackets installed just open file->open folder->select web folder->select live preview(that little icon on top right)
That should open the new chrome window with app running on one of the local ports

3. both angularjs and bootstrap and added locally cause i sometimes my browser refused to load hem from online sources
